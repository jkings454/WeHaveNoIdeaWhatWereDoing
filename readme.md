## What is this project?
A project that will revolutionize the music world. Well most likely not but at the very least it'll do something very cool with music.

This project aims to create a music visualizer using an Arduino Nano and a heck of a lot of LEDs. Some ideas floating around are for it to be light-reactive as well as sound reactive, so that the variation in brightness will have some effect on the coloring of the LEDs. 

## How will you accomplish this.

beats me.
